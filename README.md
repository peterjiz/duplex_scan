# duplex_scan
Sort &amp; Rename recto-verso scanned batches

Own a single-sided ADF scanner. Often need to scan dual-sided pages. Using this tool, I can scan the first batch and append an odd-numbering suffix to the first batch, and then scan the second batch and append an even-numbering suffix to the second batch. 

NB: Will add usage instructions soon.
